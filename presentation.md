# 		About us
## 	What is a Retro Rabbit?

We are a software consultancy. We are technologists. We are agile.

Consultancy: We propose and implement software and technology that solve specific problems for our clients
Technologists: We are comfortable and familiar with a vast range of programming languages, platforms, systems, services, and integrations; i.e., collectively, technology.
Agile: We deliver working software early and frequently. We work closely with our clients. We embrace change. We continually improve our process. (Also means we _require_ client involvement; that it is difficult to track progress and virtually impossible to predict total dev time, partly due to dynamic requirement changes; slightly more time used up for refactoring due to limited scope of early versions)

# 		Proposed Project
## 	What we would like to build for you

Project features:
- Higher income players
- Lower income players
- Business owners

Project architecture

# 		Interface: Higher-income Players
## 	How do they access the game?

Higher-income players have access to smart phones and web browsers.
We will offer them:
- A responsive web app
- Mobile app

We will develop these mobile-first, meaning we will start with a responsive web app that works great on mobile.

# 		Features: Higher-income Players
## 	How will they play the game?

The website and the app will provide similar features.
For convenience, users can register accounts.

# 		Features for players with accounts

If a player registers an account, they will get the following conveniences:
- User-friendly authentication
- Stored payment methods
- Stored tickets
- Simple prize-claiming
- Token wallets
- Push notifiactions
- Stats for nerds

###	Authentication

An account can be linked to major authentication providers:
- Google/gmail
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Email + password
- Username + password

Multiple providers can be linked to a single account, allowing convenient authentication.
Some of these providers provide info about the registerer's age, but some might require the account to be fully activated at an authority with proof of age.

### 	Account-less usage

Users who don't want to create accounts can still use the system.
Payments are done per purchase (browsers may cache payment details; the app may be configured to do the same).
Tickets are received at any (combination of) methods:
- Email
- SMS
- Downloaded PDF

### 	Stored Payment Methods

A player can register payment methods, which can be used for instant payments.

### 	Stored tickets

Purchased tickets are stored to an account. 
A player can see all their tickets in one place.

### 	Prize claiming

Prizes can be claimed with the help of the web-app or app.
For small winnings that do not warrant in-person claims*, the amount can be payed out to a linked card.
* For the Ithuba National Lottery, prizes under R2000 can be claimed at any outlet.
For large winnings, user can:
- Get their tickets out of the app storage
	- as scannable QR codes (inside the app)
	- emailed to them
	- downloaded as PDF to be printed
- Get a filled-out claim form*
* The Ithuba lotto requires one for larger winnings

### 	Tokens instead of cash

The account has an associated token wallet.
To encourage users to take tokens, a prize pays out more in tokens than cash.
Tokens are used to buy more tickets.

### 	Push notifications

Users can be instantly notified about winnings
Users can be reminded about weekly draws, especially if they haven't bought tickets.
We can notify users about special jackpots etc.

### 	Stats for nerds

Interested users can check out the odds, the latest number of entrants, etc.

# 		Features: Lower-income Players
## 	How will they play the game?

Tickets are purchased via USSD or SMS menus.
The final purchase will be charged to the player using premium-priced USSD or SMS.

// TODO: don't have MVP in the slides

# 		Proposed MVPs
## 	Target your key market first

The lower-income demographic generally spends more on lottery tickets.
This presents two opportunities:
1. Target an existing userbase that is known to be interested in your product
2. Target a new userbase by re-marketing the product

# 		MVP-A
## 	Targeting the lower-income demographic

Demographic has limited access to technology, and especially to the internet.

Users will access the system using
- Basic phones (no internet capabilities)
- Feature phones (basic internet capabilities)
- Terminals
- Tellers

Basic phones:
- Tickets are purchased over USSD or SMS
- Ticket price is deducted from player's airtime using premium-rated USSD or SMS. This requires integration with the carriers.
- The ticket is sent to the user via SMS

Terminals:
- Tickets are purchased at a hardware terminal
- The hardware will be provided by a 3rd party
- Upon purchase, the ticket is printed

Tellers:
- At select shops (such as garages), plugins or extensions for the teller's systems will interface with our system
- Tickets are purchased over the counter
- Purchased tickets are printed by the slip machine
- Payment to your company is handled by a 3rd party

// TODO: too much for an MVP! Only choose one option.



// TODO: expand MVP!

# 		MVP-B
## 	Targeting the higher-income demographic

Demographic has access to hi-tech consumer electronics, and have expectations about the services they access.

// TODO: expand MVP

# 		Complete Project
## 	After the MVP

Once an MVP is out in the wild, we can expand the system to cater for additional user experiences.

// TODO: expand complete project.
